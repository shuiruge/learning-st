## Form

All materials are arranged in the form as follow, stated recursively.

Every block of materials in the same topic is headed by an positive rational number. The first number of it, i.e. that just before the period, denotes the main topic; the rational number `B` by adding an integer to the end of a rational number `A` leads the comment of the material that the `A` leads.

This follows Wittgenstein. It forces rearrangement again and again, systematizing the whole.
